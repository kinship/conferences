# Introducing Juvet: Building Bots in Elixir

## Abstract

There is another massive shift happening with how we interact with companies through software. Users feel comfortable naturally talking with their applications through chat bots. Chat is the next generation of the user interface.

Companies like Slack, Facebook, WhatsApp, and WeChat have some of the most popular apps in the world and they are all betting on a messaging interface.

Elixir is the perfect language and ecosystem for building bots and for conversational interfaces. In this session, we will see how we can build scalable, realtime web applications (or “bots”) using a new library Juvet and the Slack API. We will see what a good bot architecture looks like and how we can integrate with existing artificial intelligence services to make our bots smarter.

## Details

The theme of the talk is around chatbots, specifically why they are important in software development, what makes a good chatbot in terms of UI considerations, design, and architecture.

For the other half of the talk, I would like to introduce a new OSS project that allows developers to easily build bots in Elixir. We will talk about why we should be building bots in Elixir and reviewing key implementations for connecting your bot, chat, conversations, and natural language processing.

## Pitch

Designing chatbots will soon be an essential skill that all developers should know. Chat will at the very least an extension of the existing services their apps provide or the sole platform and at the most, the sole way users interact with our applications.

In addition, we need to make chatbots better as a whole industry. They are not in the best state right now but all the large companies are investing billions of dollars in the technology. We need to talk about how we can improve the space.

I have been building chatbots since the early days of Campfire. I have a successful bot in the Slack app store, and I am creating an open source Elixir framework for easily creating bots.
