# The Great Gatsby: Building Fast Static Sites in React

## Abstract

There are a lot of choices when building static sites. A new rising star is Gatsby: a static site generator built in React. You'll learn about the benefits of static sites in general and what makes Gatsby a compelling choice. Once we get over some hurdles with React we'll dive into topics such as data fetching from static files and CMSes like WordPress and Contentful, styling with styled-components, and continuous deployment with GitHub to Netlify and Amazon S3. You'll walk away with all the knowledge you need to build a site that feels almost instantaneous to your users and costs practically nothing to host.
