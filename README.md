Conferences
===========

A collection of nerd events.

## DESCRIPTION

This is a repository of mark down documents and issues that help track what conferences are coming up and what team members are attending, speaking at, or organizing.

The project board can track what who is doing what and what conferences are upcoming.

### Upcoming conferences

If there are any conferences you are aware of, please add them to the [list of conferences](CONFERENCES.md). Include any details you know about the conference including dates, urls for the conference and CFP, weather or not travel is taken care of, and any other additional details. In addition, please create an issue with a due date as the first day of the conference and place it in the `upcoming` column on the project board.

### Attending conferences

If you are planning on attending a conference, add your name to the issue for the conference and place in the attending column. If someone else is speaking at or organizing the conference, ...

### Speaking at a conference

If you have submitted to a conference, add your name to the issue for the conference and place it in the `submitted` column.

If you are accepted to the conference, move the issue to the `accepted` column.

If you have been rejected from speaking, you can either move the issue to the `rejected` column or close the issue. It's up to you if you want to track that.

If you have declined the speaking offer, you can either move the issue to the `declined` column or close the issue. It's up to you if you want to track that.

### Organizing a conference

This is a new area since we have no experience here. There are a bunch of moving parts to organizing a conference so, for any conference you want to organize, please create an issue, assign yourself to the issue, and place the issue in the `organizing` column.

### Conferences that have completed

Once the conference has ended, please close the issue for the conference.

## CONTRIBUTING

If you are part of the Kinship team, feel free to just push to master for any new conference you find out about. :man_shrugging: Please add the appropriate issue as well.

If you want to add to the [list of conferences](CONFERENCES.md) on this open source repo so others find it or you want to bring it to the attention of the Kinship team, please create a PR for the [list of conferences](CONFERENCES.md) and/or open an issue for it. It would help out the community if you did both :)
